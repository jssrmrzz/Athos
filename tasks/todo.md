# Project Tasks & Status

## Business Owner Button Fix - COMPLETED (2025-07-08)

### Problem
The "Business Owner" text in the Dashboard Topbar was static with no click functionality, preventing users from accessing business management features.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Setup React Router Structure** ✅
   - Added Routes and Route components to App.tsx
   - Created routing for main pages and business management

2. **Created BusinessDropdown Component** ✅
   - Built interactive dropdown replacing static text
   - Added click-outside-to-close functionality
   - Implemented dark mode support

3. **Built Business Management Pages** ✅
   - BusinessSettings: Complete settings page for business configuration
   - BusinessUsers: Team member management with role-based access
   - BusinessProfile: Overview of business information and stats

4. **Enhanced User Experience** ✅
   - Added proper navigation with react-router-dom
   - Updated Sidebar with dark mode support
   - Created responsive design for mobile devices

### Files Created/Modified
- `src/Dashboard/src/components/business/BusinessDropdown.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/Dashboard/src/pages/business/BusinessSettings.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/Dashboard/src/pages/business/BusinessUsers.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/Dashboard/src/pages/business/BusinessProfile.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/Dashboard/src/App.tsx` (UPDATED - Added routing)
- `src/Dashboard/src/components/layout/Topbar.tsx` (UPDATED - Added dropdown)
- `src/Dashboard/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` (UPDATED - Dark mode)

### Result
- ✅ Business Owner button now functional with dropdown menu
- ✅ Navigation to Business Settings, User Management, and Profile
- ✅ Fully responsive design with dark mode support
- ✅ Ready for backend API integration

## OAuth Configuration Fix - COMPLETED (2025-07-09)

### Problem
Google OAuth integration was failing with ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE errors due to configuration mismatches between frontend HTTP/HTTPS protocols and backend OAuth endpoints.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Protocol Mismatch**: Frontend using HTTP while backend running on HTTPS
2. **Route Configuration**: Multiple inconsistencies in OAuth redirect URIs
3. **Mock API Interference**: Initial issue was frontend using mock API mode
4. **Configuration Drift**: appsettings.json, Google Cloud Console, and controller routes were inconsistent

### Solution Implemented
1. **Frontend Protocol Fix** ✅
   - Updated `useApi.ts` to use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Changed from `http://${host}:7157` to `https://${host}:7157`

2. **OAuth Route Consistency** ✅
   - Fixed appsettings.json RedirectUri to match controller route
   - Updated controller callback route to `/google/callback`
   - Ensured all components use `https://localhost:7157/api/oauth/google/callback`

3. **Enhanced Error Logging** ✅
   - Added comprehensive logging to OAuth authorize endpoint
   - Improved error visibility for debugging future issues

4. **Configuration Validation** ✅
   - Verified Google Cloud Console redirect URI matches backend
   - Confirmed backend runs on HTTPS port 7157
   - Validated OAuth flow configuration end-to-end

### Files Modified
- `src/Dashboard/src/hooks/useApi.ts` - Fixed HTTP to HTTPS protocol
- `src/ReviewAutomation/Api/appsettings.json` - Corrected redirect URI
- `src/ReviewAutomation/Api/Controllers/OAuthController.cs` - Enhanced logging

### Result
- ✅ OAuth protocol mismatch resolved
- ✅ Configuration consistency across all components
- ✅ Enhanced error visibility for troubleshooting
- ✅ Ready for Google OAuth testing with proper HTTPS endpoints

## Unified Sign Out Implementation - COMPLETED (2025-07-10)

### Problem
The "Sign Out" button in BusinessDropdown was not working because it called ASP.NET Core logout endpoints, but the app uses OAuth token-based authentication. Users could only disconnect via Business Settings → Integrations.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Updated useAuth Hook** ✅
   - Changed from ASP.NET logout to OAuth revoke endpoint call
   - Uses same `/oauth/google/revoke` endpoint as working Disconnect feature
   - Added proper business context (`X-Business-Id` header) and error handling
   - Maintains robust fallback that always clears local data

2. **Enhanced User Experience** ✅
   - Added loading states with spinning LogOut icon
   - Integrated toast notifications for success/error feedback
   - Disabled button during sign out process to prevent double-clicks
   - Shows "Signing Out..." text during operation for clear user feedback

### Files Modified
- `src/Dashboard/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` (UPDATED - OAuth revoke logic instead of ASP.NET logout)
- `src/Dashboard/src/components/business/BusinessDropdown.tsx` (UPDATED - Loading states, toast notifications, UX improvements)

### Result
- ✅ Sign Out button now works properly and revokes Google OAuth tokens
- ✅ Unified authentication experience (Sign Out = Disconnect from Google)
- ✅ Consistent user feedback and loading states across the application
- ✅ Clear single authentication concept: Connected = Authenticated
- ✅ No more user confusion between "sign out" and "disconnect" functionality

## Mock Mode OAuth Configuration Fix - COMPLETED (2025-07-10)

### Problem
Mock mode in the dashboard was not displaying reviews due to OAuth configuration errors during application startup. The application was trying to validate Google OAuth credentials even when using mock APIs, causing the server to fail with "ClientId cannot be empty" errors.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Startup OAuth Validation**: Google OAuth authentication was being configured during application startup in Program.cs
2. **Empty Configuration**: appsettings.json had empty strings for ClientId and ClientSecret
3. **Global Authentication**: OAuth validation was occurring for all endpoints, including mock APIs
4. **Route Conflicts**: Duplicate routes in App.tsx were preventing proper component rendering

### Solution Implemented
1. **Conditional OAuth Registration** ✅
   - Updated Program.cs to only register Google OAuth when ClientId and ClientSecret are provided
   - Added null/empty checks before calling .AddGoogle() authentication service
   - Preserved all OAuth functionality when credentials are properly configured

2. **Mock API Middleware Enhancement** ✅
   - Added `/api/mock` to BusinessContextMiddleware skip list
   - Mock endpoints now bypass authentication requirements entirely
   - Maintained security for production API endpoints

3. **Frontend Route Cleanup** ✅
   - Removed duplicate routes from App.tsx that were causing conflicts
   - Cleaned up unused imports (DashboardPage)
   - Ensured ReviewList component renders properly on root route

### Files Modified
- `src/ReviewAutomation/Api/Program.cs` - Added conditional OAuth registration logic
- `src/ReviewAutomation/Api/Middleware/BusinessContextMiddleware.cs` - Added /api/mock to skip list
- `src/Dashboard/src/App.tsx` - Removed duplicate routes and unused imports

### Result
- ✅ Mock mode works independently without requiring OAuth configuration
- ✅ Mock reviews display properly in dashboard when Mock Mode is enabled
- ✅ "Reset Mock Data" functionality works without authentication errors
- ✅ OAuth functionality fully preserved when credentials are configured
- ✅ Development workflow improved with flexible authentication setup
- ✅ Both backend and frontend builds pass successfully

## Next Steps
- Test OAuth flow end-to-end with Google authorization
- Implement additional OAuth error handling if needed
- Connect BusinessDropdown to backend business APIs for real data
- Add form validation and error handling
- Integrate with authentication system

## Summary
Successfully transformed static "Business Owner" text into a fully functional business management interface with proper routing and modern UI components.
