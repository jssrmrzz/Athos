**Unified Sign Out Implementation - Authentication Experience Fix**
- **Time:** 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM

  - Successfully resolved user confusion between "sign out" and "disconnect" functionality
  - Established single authentication concept: Connected = Authenticated

  - **Frontend Route Cleanup:**
    - `src/Dashboard/src/App.tsx` (removed duplicate routes and unused imports)

  - **Root Cause Analysis:** OAuth configuration was being validated during startup even with empty ClientId/ClientSecret
  - **Conditional OAuth Registration:** Modified Program.cs to only register Google OAuth when credentials are provided
  - **Mock API Bypass:** Enhanced BusinessContextMiddleware to skip authentication for /api/mock endpoints
  - **Route Conflict Resolution:** Cleaned up duplicate routes in App.tsx that were preventing ReviewList from displaying
  - **Development Experience:** Mock mode now works independently without requiring OAuth configuration
